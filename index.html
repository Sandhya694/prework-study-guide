      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML is short for "HyperText Markup Language"</li>
        <li>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display
          the content.</li>
        <li>The html tags defines the document as web page. It also identifies the beginning and end of the HTML
          document. All other tags must fall between the html tags.</li>
        <li>The body tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page. All your images, links and
          plain text must go between the body tags.</li>
        <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety
          of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers</li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what
          appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
        <li>The h1 through h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are
          exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page</li>
        <li>The biggest heading h1 should only appear once on each page.</li>
        <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
        <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML
          elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
        <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. It can contain various
          attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
        <li> The hyperlink, the "a" element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other
          webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
        <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document</li>
