      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML is short for "HyperText Markup Language"</li>
        <li>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display
          the content.</li>
        <li>The html tags defines the document as web page. It also identifies the beginning and end of the HTML
          document. All other tags must fall between the html tags.</li>
        <li>The body tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page. All your images, links and
          plain text must go between the body tags.</li>
        <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety
          of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers</li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what
          appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
        <li>The h1 through h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are
          exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page</li>
        <li>The biggest heading h1 should only appear once on each page.</li>
        <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
        <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML
          elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
        <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. It can contain various
          attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
        <li> The hyperlink, the "a" element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other
          webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
        <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS-Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
          written
          in a markup language such as HTML</li>
        <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet
          <ul>
            <li> To style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific
              HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only

            </li>
            <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules
              only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements,
              to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in
              most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design
              changes easier.When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the
              HTML's head</li>


          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CSS rules
          <ul>
            <li>selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the
              property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that
              property, blue.</li>
            <li>A selector can have multiple declarations thenit is called as declaration block</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CSS BOX MODEL
          <ul>
            <li>The content box-which is the area that the content lives in</li>
            <li>The padding box-surrounds the content box and is the space created by the padding property</li>
            <li>The border box-surrounds the padding box and its space is occupied by the border value</li>
            <li>The final area, the margin box, is the space around your box, defined by the margin rule on your box
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>* is called universal selector any declaration included here will be applied to the whole page</li>
        <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both
          selectors</li>
        <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class
          attribute with a class selector</li>
        <li>The period preceding class attribute name designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to
          the class, will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>

      <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is the programming language of the Web</li>
        <li>JavaScript code is inserted between script tags. It can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an
          HTML page</li>
        <li>javaScript files have the file extension .js.To use an external script, put the name of the script file in
          the src (source) attribute of a script tag</li>
        <li>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>The cSemicolons separate JavaScript statements. Add a semicolon at the end of each executable
          statementonsole. log() method outputs a message to the web console</li>
        <li>Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values). Variables, declared with the var,let or
          const keyword</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script,code runs from the first statement
          at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
        <li>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.A JavaScript function is
          executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)</li>

        <li>The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:(parameter1, parameter2, ...)The code to be
          executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}</li>
        <li>else-to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false </li>
        <li> if - to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>

        <li>Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.Expression 2 defines the
          condition for executing the code block.Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been
